## Hello, I'm Maihong

I'm a Business Analytics professional with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights. With my foundation in Economics and hands-on entrepreneurial experience, I bridge the gap between analytical thinking and practical business solutions.

My journey through data science began during my undergraduate studies when I discovered how powerful analytical tools could transform business decision-making. This fascination led me to pursue my MS in Business Analytics at Boston University, where I've been expanding my technical toolkit while developing strategic business acumen.

What drives me is the challenge of finding the story behind the numbers and creating value from seemingly disparate data points. Whether it's optimizing marketing campaigns, streamlining supply chains, or enhancing customer experiences, I find fulfillment in delivering data-driven solutions that make a tangible impact.

At Beijing Radio Cultural Transmission, I discovered my passion for digital audience engagement. By developing Python ETL pipelines and implementing clustering algorithms to segment 500K+ fans, I learned to translate raw engagement metrics into strategic marketing decisions. Seeing our hashtags climb to top rankings on Weibo and Douyin validated the power of data-backed content strategies.
